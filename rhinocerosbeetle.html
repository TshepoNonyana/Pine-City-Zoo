                    <h3>RHINOCEROS BEETLE</h3>
                    <p>Dynastinae or rhinoceros beetles are a subfamily of the scarab beetle family (Scarabaeidae). 
                    Other common names – some for particular groups of rhinoceros beetles – include Hercules beetles, unicorn beetles or horn beetles. 
                    Over 1,500 species and 225 genera of rhinoceros beetles are known.</p>
                    <p>Many rhinoceros beetles are well known for their unique shapes and large sizes. 
                    Some famous species are, for example, the Atlas beetle (Chalcosoma atlas), common rhinoceros beetle (Xylotrupes ulysses), elephant beetle (Megasoma elephas), 
                    European rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes nasicornis), Hercules beetle (Dynastes hercules), Japanese rhinoceros beetle or kabutomushi (Allomyrina dichotoma), ox beetle (Strategus aloeus) and the Eastern Hercules beetle (Dynastes tityus).</p>
                    <p>The Dynastinae are among the largest of beetles, reaching more than 15 centimetres (6 inches) in length, but are completely harmless to humans because they cannot bite or sting. 
                    Some species have been anecdotally claimed to lift up to 850 times their own weight.
                    An extinct Eocene Oryctoantiquus borealis was the largest fossil scarabeid, with a length of 5 centimetres (2.0 in).
                    Some modern Oryctini grew up to 7 cm (3 in).
                    Common names of the Dynastinae refer to the characteristic horns borne only by the males of most species in the group. 
                    Each has a horn on the head and another horn pointing forward from the center of the thorax. 
                    The horns are used in fighting other males during mating season, and for digging. 
                    The size of the horn is a good indicator of nutrition and physical health.</p>
